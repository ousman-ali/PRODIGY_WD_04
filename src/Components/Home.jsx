          As a skilled developer, I have a great passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites. In order to fulfill my passion and become an expert in React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I'm trying to learn and develop a range of projects that showcase my versatility and problem-solving abilities. During the journey of the learning process and gaining hands-on experience, Prodigy InfoTech Company is playing an invaluable role by giving me the opportunity to be an intern.
