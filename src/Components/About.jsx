            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
            As a beginner in web development, I initially had no prior experience as a developer in this field. However, I have been proactively building my skills and gaining hands-on experience. My journey includes working with popular frameworks like React, as well as developing proficiency in core web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Notably, I have had the opportunity to apply and expand my knowledge through an internship at Prodigy Info Tech Company. This internship has allowed me to translate my theoretical understanding into practical, real-world experience, further strengthening my capabilities as an aspiring web developer.
